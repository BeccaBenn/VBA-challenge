Stock Market Data Analysis with VBA Scripting

Overview
This is a project created for UCSB Data Analytics Bootcamp.
This VBA script is designed to analyze stock market data generated for multiple years. It loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs various information including the ticker symbol, yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume. Additionally, it identifies the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The script is capable of running on every worksheet (representing each year's data) at once.

Output
The script will generate output similar to the provided image, showing the required information for each stock as well as identifying the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.
